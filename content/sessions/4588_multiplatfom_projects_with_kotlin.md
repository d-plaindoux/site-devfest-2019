Kotlin is an alternative programming language for JVM. But it is not limited to a single platform. Instead, the team is working hard to bring it everywhere. It is already possible to run Kotlin on Android and compile it to JavaScript to write homogeneous web applications. And there is Kotlin/Native project actively in development, which will bring Kotlin to desktop and iOS.

In this session, we'll see how Kotlin can help us share code between platforms and what are the best practices in doing this.
